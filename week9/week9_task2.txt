TASK2:

Q2a)

It is not possible to get a value >52 or <48

Q2b)
This is to simulate calculation delays and manually trigger data racing.
There will be a few situation:
 - One thread gets the value, modify and return back to gloabl, then the next thread begins, in this case, value is added, then minused. Value will be 50
 - One thread gets the value, modify, and the second thread gets the value and modify.
   - 1/2 chance where thread1 will replace global first and then the global is override by thread2
   - 1/2 chance where thread2 will replace global before thread1, and will be overriden by thread1
   Either case the final value is 48 or 52

Q2c)
We cannot predict the output unless we fully inspect the procedures the computer schedules, which is not practical.

Q2d)
One thread has to get the global value after another thread has returned the val back to global
