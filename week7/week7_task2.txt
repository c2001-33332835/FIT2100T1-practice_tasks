No matter what limit is, FIT2100 will print once.

=== when limit is 2:

Operating * 3, System * 4
It loops 2 times
The first time, 1 process: Operating * 1
The Second time, 2 processes: Operating * 2
Outside the loop, 4 processes: System * 4

=== When limit is 1:
Operating * 1, System * 2

=== When limit is 3:
Operating * 7, System * 8

=== When increase the limit to n:

Operating * (\Sigma_{i=0}^(n-1)2^i), System * 2^n

the first time: 1 process: Operating * 1
the second time: 2 processes: Operating * 2
...
the n-th time: 2^(n-1) processes: Operating * 2^(n-1)
Outside the loop: 2^n processes: ÓÅêSystem * 2^n
