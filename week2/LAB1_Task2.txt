### A) file size of two compiled files

when source code is being compiled using the `-g` flag, there are debug information being embeded into the executable, thus the file size are larger.  
The original file is 20664B, and the file with `-g` flag is 21376B, different in 712B.

### B) Warning message.

The raw warning message outputted by gcc is:

```
Task2.c: In function ‘main’:
Task2.c:5:23: warning: multi-character character constant [-Wmultichar]
    5 |         char string = 'N/A'; // Initialise our string
      |                       ^~~~~
Task2.c:5:23: warning: overflow in conversion from ‘int’ to ‘char’ changes value from ‘5123905’ to ‘65’ [-Woverflow]
```

The code at line 5 was complained by the gcc compiler.
